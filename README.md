# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Analytics Engineer

This repository includes everything you need to run and inspect my work.

**implementation.ipynb** include both the code and the relevant notes detailing my thought process in completing the tasks.

For simplicity, I used the locally available SQLite dialect in writing SQL. I typically work in Redshift SQL.

**responses.ipynb** contains only the diagram, questions and answers, and the email to the stakeholder. It contains no code or notes and is meant to offer a clean view of the deliverables.
