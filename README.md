# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Analytics Engineer

This repository includes all the files you need to run and inspect my work.

## Repository Breakdown

- **implementation.ipynb** includes both the code and the relevant notes detailing my thought process in completing the tasks

- **responses.ipynb** contains only the diagram, questions and answers, and the email to the stakeholder. It contains no notes and is meant to offer a clean view of the deliverables

- **images** contains the image of the rendered ER diagram. I created it with https://dbdiagram.io

- **datasets** contains the three provided json files for the exercise

## Notes

- For simplicity, I used the locally available SQLite dialect in writing SQL. I typically work with Redshift SQL

- I used Python 3.11.5 to run the notebooks, but other versions will most likely work as well
